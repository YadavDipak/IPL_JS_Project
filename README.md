# IPL Data Project :

This is a IPL data set project where we have to used JavaScript programming language to find out the result.

### There should be 2 files:

- deliveries.csv
- matches.csv

In this data we will transform raw data of IPL to calculate the following stats:

- `Number of matches played per year for all the years in IPL.`

- `Number of matches won per team per year in IPL.`

- `Extra runs conceded per team in the year 2016.`

- `Top 10 economical bowlers in the year 2015.`

- `Find the number of times each team won the toss and also won the match.`

- `Find a player who has won the highest number of Player of the Match awards for each season.`

- `Find the strike rate of a batsman for each season.`

- `Find the highest number of times one player has been dismissed by another player.`

- `Find the bowler with the best economy in super overs.`

Implemented the functions (IPL -> src -> server), one for each task and stored the results of the functions to dump JSON files in the output folder (IPL -> src -> public -> output).
